<PackageLinks npmName="@nimpl/getters" githubName="nimpl-getters" />

(Former [next-impl-getters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-impl-getters))

Implementation of server getters in React Server Components without switching to SSR.

*Before using the library, read the [Possible Issues](#possible-issues)*

## Installation

**Using npm:**
```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @nimpl/getters
```

## Current Getters

* [get-pathname](#get-pathname)
* [get-page-config](#get-page-config)
* [get-params](#get-params)
* [get-search-params](#get-search-params)

<Hint>
Contexts, due to the release of react v19, have been moved to a separate package - [@nimpl/context](./context.mdx)
</Hint>

## Stability

All getters are covered with tests. Tests are run on every release and every 6 hours on the latest **Canary** version of `Next.js`.

In this way, you can be sure not only of the stability of the code, but also that if there is a breaking change in `Next.js`, this will immediately become known. *Even before the release of a stable version of `Next.js`.*

## get-pathname

*Uses next.js functionality*

Retrieves pathname for the currently rendered page in React Server Component. Works the same as [usePathname](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname), but in a React server component.

*The getter almost fully utilizes Next.js functionality*

```tsx
import { getPathname } from '@nimpl/getters/get-pathname'

export default function Component() {
    const pathname = getPathname()

    return (
        // ...
    )
}
```

## get-params

*Uses next.js functionality*

Retrieves dynamic parameters for the current page. Works the same as [useParams](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-params), but in a React server component.

For example, for a page at the directory `/[locale]/blog/[slug]` and pathname `/en-de/blog/example` - the getter will return `{ locale: 'en-de', slug: 'example' }`

```tsx
import { getParams } from '@nimpl/getters/get-params'

export default function Component() {
    const params = getParams()

    return (
        // ...
    )
}
```

**Options**

You can pass params object as arguments to getParams.

`ignoreDifferenceError` - this option disables difference errors, and in such situations, the function will simply return `null`.

`pagePaths` - custom page paths for parsing the current pathname (e.g., `["/specific/[locale]/[...subpaths]/page", "/[locale]/base/[...subpaths]/page"]`).

```ts
const params = getParams({
  ignoreDifferenceError: true,
  pagePaths: ["/specific/[locale]/[...subpaths]/page", "/[locale]/base/[...subpaths]/page"],
});
// "/specific/de/unknown-page" -> { locale: "de", subpaths: ["unknown-page"] }
// "/it/base/unknown-page" -> { locale: "it", subpaths: ["unknown-page"] }
// "/it/invalid/unknown-page" -> null
```

## get-page-config

*Uses next.js functionality*

Gets the next.js page configuration for the currently rendered page in React Server Component.

**Supported configuration data**

`basePath` - project base path (sub-path of a domain). Read more in [next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath)

`dynamic` - next.js dynamic behavior option. Read more in [next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic)

`pagePath` - path to the page in the folder structure (f.e. `/[locale]/blog/[slug]`)

```tsx
import { getPageConfig } from '@nimpl/getters/get-page-config'
// ...

export default function Component() {
    const { basePath, dynamic, pagePath } = getPageConfig()

    // getters are not hooks, so you can use them inside conditions
    if (dynamic === 'force-dynamic') {
        const searchParams = getSearchParams()
        // ...
    }

    return (
        // ...
    )
}
```

## get-search-params

**Getter was deprecated in version 1.2.0.**

Retrieves search params for the currently rendered page in React Server Component. Works the same as [useSearchParams](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params), but in a React server component.

**Possible custom implementation**

This functionality makes no sense without dynamic mode, so you can use headers to implement it

1\. Add URL header in middleware

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
 
export function middleware(request: Request) {
  const next = NextResponse.next();
  next.headers.set('x-url', request.url);

  return next;
}
```

2\. Use new header

```ts
import { headers } from 'next/headers';
import { getPageConfig } from '@nimpl/getters/get-page-config';

export default function Component() {
    const { dynamic } = getPageConfig();

    if (dynamic === 'force-dynamic') {
        const url = headers().get('x-url') || '';
        const { searchParams } = new URL(url, 'http://n');
    }
}
```

## What's next?

Why getters instead of extending existing hooks?

I'm not very fond of the idea of extending hooks - on the server, it won't be a hook no matter how you look at it. These are specifically getters. Moreover, a client-side hook can be synchronous, while a server-side getter for the same task can be asynchronous, making it a more versatile format.

## Possible Issues

A potential problem with server getters is the desire to use them inside `Layout`. This is impossible. Layouts don't re-render, as it's built into the framework.

Unfortunately, it's currently not possible to create a warning for this, so be careful and don't use getters inside `Layout`.

## Development

Read about working on the package and making changes on the [contribution page](./contribution.mdx)

## Additional

This package came as an attempt to implement a working get-pathname solution while waiting for a [PR](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/59909) merge to add get-pathname to next.js. However, it proved to be an independent solution.

Please consider giving a star if you like it, it shows that the package is useful and helps continue work on this and other packages.

Create issues with wishes, ideas, difficulties, etc. All of them will definitely be considered and thought over.
