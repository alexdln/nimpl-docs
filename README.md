Nimpl (_formerly **next-impl**ementation_) was created to extend the capabilities of next.js, as well as to fill in the gaps left by the next.js team.

Nimpl includes several fully independent solutions. Each solution is completely ready for use. However, some (_for example @nimpl/getters_) depend on internal changes to next.js. All risks are detailed in the documentation of each package.

The main goal of nimpl is to make next.js not just a master tool, but a truly convenient and full-fledged framework.

I always welcome ideas and issues and respond in the shortest possible time. Feel free to write your wishes, ideas, and problems.

These works are not limited to the nimpl family. Additional tools are also being developed. For example, this site is entirely built on [RobinDoc](https://robindoc.com) - a powerful and flexible documentation generation tool.

**To make the web not only faster, but also easier!**
