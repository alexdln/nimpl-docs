# Usage

## chain

The chain takes an array of middleware. Upon request, it will sequentially process each middleware and return a NextResponse with the collected data ([summary](/middleware-chain#how-it-works)).

This could be a series of your custom middlewares:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { chain } from "@nimpl/middleware-chain";

export const middleware = chain([
    async (request: NextRequest) => {
        const next = NextResponse.next({ headers: new Headers({ "x-pathname": request.nextUrl.pathname }) });
        next.cookies.set("test", "cookie", { domain: "localhost", secure: true });
        return next;
    },
    async (request: NextRequest) => {
        return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL("/rewritten", request.url));
    },
]);
```

And a series of ready-made solutions:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { default as authMiddleware } from "next-auth/middleware";
import createMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";
import { chain } from "@nimpl/middleware-chain";

const intlMiddleware = createMiddleware({
    locales: ["en", "dk"],
    defaultLocale: "en",
});

export default chain([
    intlMiddleware,
    authMiddleware,
]);
```

**Important**: `NextResponse.rewrite`, `NextResponse.redirect`, and `NextResponse.json` do not terminate the execution of the chain. If the subsequent middleware of the chain returns a new type - the chain will continue execution with new data. At the same time, a message of the following type will be output to the console:
`http://localhost:3000/ (none) -> http://localhost:3000/rewritten (rewrite)`

This is done so that it is possible to pass several ready-made solutions (such as for example `next-auth` and `next-intl`)

You can stop the execution of the chain using `FinalNextResponse`.

## FinalNextResponse

If you wish, you can embed your middleware between the ready ones, where to stop further execution with the help of returning `FinalNextResponse`, for example if `summary.type === 'redirect'`

For instance, in the case with `next-intl` + `next-auth`, we may not want authorization handling until the redirect (*because after the redirect, the middleware will be processed again*):

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
export default chain([
    intlMiddleware,
    (req) => {
        if (req.summary.type === "redirect") return FinalNextResponse.next();
    },
    authMiddleware,
]);
```
