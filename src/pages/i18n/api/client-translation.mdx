# ClientTranslation

A component for adding complex translations in React Client Components. Unlike hooks, it supports adding components inside translations.

```tsx
"use client";

import ClientTranslation from '@nimpl/i18n/ClientTranslation';

const ClientComponent: React.FC = () => (
    <ClientTranslation
        term='intro.description' // We have {{number}} tariffs. Read more about pricings <link>special section</link>
        components={{
            link: <a href='#' />
        }}
        query={{ number: 5 }}
    />
)
```

<Hint>
The ClientTranslation and client hook [useTranslation](/i18n/api/use-translation), unlike server [getTranslation](/i18n/api/get-translation) and [ServerTranslation](/i18n/api/ServerTranslation), do not support language customization. 
This is because translations are determined by server parents, as a result, and the language is fixed in them.
