# @nimpl/i18n

(Former [next-translation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-translation))

i18n library designed primarily with server components in mind and maximum optimization (due to the transfer of logic to the assembly stage and/or server side)

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @nimpl/i18n
```

## Why one more library?

Server components are a recent feature in React. Existing translation libraries are not yet well-optimized for them. If they support it, then only by disabling Next.js static optimization.

This library is an attempt to create a highly optimized solution exclusively using the current capabilities of React.js, Next.js and node.js.

## Additionally

Create tasks with wishes, ideas, difficulties, etc. All of them will definitely be considered and thought over.
