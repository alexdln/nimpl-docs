                <p>Next.js implements a lot of functionality from release to release. Many innovations are extremely useful, but they have critical differences. These changes can hinder the transition to new versions and new approaches.</p>
                <p>At the same time, much desired functionality is still not implemented. This family of packages solves common next.js tasks, making it not only faster but also easier.</p>
