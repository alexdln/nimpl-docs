# Possible Issues

## Context loosing

The functionality of node.js, used within contexts can lose content (*and this is a quote from the developers and all available information*).

If you have experience with this issue - please share in the issues and discussions of the package.

## Layouts don't re-render

As a potential risk of a server-side solution, the problem of Layouts is mentioned, that they do not re-render, which is inherent in the app router foundation. I don't see any reason to change this logic.

The most reliable approach, in my opinion, is to output messages to the console or even throw an error when this function is used in Layout or Error without the necessary conditions.

Since at the moment it is impossible to determine in which route the component is rendered - there are no automatic errors. However, it is strongly discouraged to use this feature in layouts.
