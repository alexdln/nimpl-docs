# Possible Issues

As a potential risk of a server-side solution, the problem of Layouts is mentioned, that they do not rebuild, which is inherent in the app router foundation. I don't see any reason to change this logic.

The most reliable approach, in my opinion, is to output messages to the console or even throw an error when this function is used in Layout or Error without the necessary conditions.

Since at the moment it is impossible to determine in which route the component is rendered - there are no automatic errors. However, it is strongly discouraged to use this feature in layouts.
