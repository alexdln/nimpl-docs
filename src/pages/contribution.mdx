# Contribution

Hello! Below is a guide on how you can make changes to the nimpl family packages. If you have any questions left - feel free to raise issues and discussions on them.

Your support is not only PR, but also tasks, ideas, participation in discussions, repros, and, of course, stars.

**Thank you** very much for deciding to participate in the development of the project.

## Preparation

Before creating a task or PR, make sure that the issue or idea is relevant in the latest version of the package.

Then check the task list, perhaps your problem or idea is already known and work is being carried out on it.

Please start working by creating a task. I try to promptly respond to all emerging ideas and tasks. This will help save your time first and foremost.

Also, before starting work, you can create a discussion in the package you are interested in. I will also try to answer all questions in them.

You can read about how to interact with Github for contributing to the package on the [GitHub Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) page.

## Release cycle

Task development begins with the canary branch. It is from it that the branch is created for the task that you want to perform.

After completing the task, a PR is created from the branch you created for the task to the canary branch.

Then a canary release of the package will be issued.

When the changes are ready for a stable release, a new branch will be created from the canary branch for the stable version release.

## Package Development

All family packages use pnpm as the package manager, ts as the development language, eslint and prettier as code formatting and quality checking tools;

After cloning the package, you need to configure pnpm:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

And install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

After installing the packages, husky will be set up - it will check the code rules during commits.

## Test changes

After refining the packages, I recommend immediately correcting the formatting:

```bash
pnpm run lint --fix
```

Also, some packages have tests. The work with tests will be further developed and described later.

To build TS you can go to the package directory and call `pnpm build`.

Also, you can build TS from the root directory by calling `pnpm nimpl:NAME build`, where NAME is the key of the package (f.e. to build the `@nimpl/i18n` package the command will be `pnpm nimpl:i18n build`)

Now you can install the modified package into your project:

```bash
pnpm install ../path/to/nimpl/package
```

Package managers also support the "link" functionality for linking a package ([npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-link), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/cli/link), [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/)).
The advantage of this method is that when changes are made to the package, you won't need to reinstall it, but simply rebuild it.
