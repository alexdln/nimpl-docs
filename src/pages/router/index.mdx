Edge router for next.js apps.
Allows you to configure `rewrites`, `redirects`, `i18n` and `basePath` at the `middleware` level instead of `next.config.js`.

## Motivation

All these settings are much more efficient in @nimpl/router and in edge runtime for several reasons:

1. The Edge is best suited for redirects.
Instead of the `Client -> Edge -> Server -> Redirect -> Client -> Edge -> Server -> Response` journey, it becomes `Client -> Edge -> Redirect -> Client -> Edge -> Server -> Response`.
That is, instead of two long journeys to the server, the client goes to the CDN and then goes to the server only for the necessary route.

2. Next.js `i18n` is full of bugs, and in the latest versions, they completely abandoned it, recommending using middleware.

3. In `middleware`, you can decide for yourself which settings to enable for which paths, which rules to set, which redirect lists for `/app` paths, and which for `/marketing`.
Take a look at the [middleware-chain](https://nimpl.tech/middleware-chain) to get the most flexible and suitable configuration for you.

## Installation

**Using npm:**
```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @nimpl/router
```

## Example

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { createMiddleware } from '@nimpl/router';

export const middleware = createMiddleware({
    redirects: [
        {
            source: '/old',
            destination: '/',
            permanent: false,
        },
    ],
    rewrites: [
        {
            source: '/home',
            destination: '/',
            locale: false,
        },
    ],
    basePath: '/doc',
    i18n: {
        defaultLocale: 'en',
        locales: ['en', 'de'],
    },
});
```

## Options

The options either completely repeat the next.js API, or they are as close as possible to them.

`rewrites` - absolutely identical next.js rewrites. [Next.config.js/rewrites documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites)

`redirects` - absolutely identical next.js redirects. [Next.config.js/redirects documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects)

`basePath` - path prefix for the application (f.e. `/docs`, `/blog`, `/v2`)

<Hint>
For flexibility, it is recommended not to use basePath in next.config.js, but to manually set the prefix in the links.
</Hint>

`i18n` - configuration for localized paths.

<Hint>
Unlike the next.config.js solution, it has nothing to do with Link and does not participate in the generation of page paths.
That is, localization should be embedded in the structure of the application (e.g. app/[lang]/page.tsx).
</Hint>

Also, instead of a boolean `localeDetection`, the router takes a `localeDetector` method where you can set up how exactly to get the locale (_f.e. from a CloudFlare header_)

Otherwise, it repeats the logic of next.js. [Next.config.js/i18n documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)

<Hint>
It is recommended not to use i18n in next.config.js, but to manually set the required locale in the links.

## Additional

Please consider giving a star if you like it, it shows that the package is useful and helps me continue work on this and other packages.

Create issues with wishes, ideas, difficulties, etc. All of them will definitely be considered and thought over.
