# @nimpl/classnames-minifier

<PackageLinks npmName="@nimpl/classnames-minifier" githubName="nimpl-classnames-minifier" />

(Former [next-classnames-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-classnames-minifier))

Library for configuring style _(css/scss/sass)_ modules to generate compressed classes (`.header` -> `.a`, `.nav` -> `.b`, ..., `.footer` -> `.aad`, etc.) with support for changes and rebuilding without clearing the built application. The package itself synchronizes minified classnames with components of the application compiled earlier.

## Installation

**Using npm:**
```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @nimpl/classnames-minifier
```

## Reasons

*Compressing classes* can reduce the size of the generated html and css by up to *20%*, which will have a positive effect on page rendering and metrics (primarily [FCP](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/))
