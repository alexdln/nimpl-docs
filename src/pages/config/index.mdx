# @nimpl/config

(Former [next-impl-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-impl-config))

The package adding support for configuration for each possible next.js environment (*build, server, client, and edge*)

## Motivation

For the config, Next.js only offers environment variables - regular ones for the server, and ones with NEXT_PUBLIC prefix, which will be embedded during the build process.

And here are a few downsides:

- It's not convenient for large configuration objects.
- It doesn't cover all use cases, such as runtime config and react runtime config (when the image is built once and used in different environments).

On the other hand, @nimpl/config offers support for 4 different configuration options for your applications.

Another important advantage of @nimpl/config is that it supports functions (*synchronous and asynchronous*) and will successfully merge their result.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @nimpl/config
```
