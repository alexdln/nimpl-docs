# nimpl/config

The package allows for convenient management of application configuration in Next.js environments.

## Motivation

For the config, Next.js only offers environment variables - regular ones for the server, and ones with NEXT_PUBLIC prefix, which will be embedded during the build process.

And here are a few downsides:

- It's not convenient for large configuration objects.
- It doesn't cover all use cases, such as runtime config and react runtime config (when the image is built once and used in different environments).

On the other hand, next-impl-config offers support for 4 different configuration options for your applications.

Another important advantage of next-impl-config is that it supports functions (*synchronous and asynchronous*) and will successfully merge their result.

## Installation

**Using npm:**
```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i nimpl/config
```
