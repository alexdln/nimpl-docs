# Structure

All configs are stored in the config directory. Each variant is stored independently in a subdirectory with the same name.

config

- server
- build
- postbuild
- runtime

All types support the following config variants:

- default.js
- default.local.js
- [TARGET_ENV].js
- [TARGET_ENV].local.js
- envs.js
- envs.local.js

The lower the config variant is in the list, the higher its priority.

- default.js: Used as the default value, all config keys should be filled in this file.
- [TARGET_ENV].js: Environment-dependent config (see [environment-dependent config](/config/configuration#environment-dependent-config)).
- envs.js: Config with environment variables as values.
- .local.js versions: Local versions that should be added to gitignore.
