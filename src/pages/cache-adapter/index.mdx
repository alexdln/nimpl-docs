# @nimpl/cache-adapter

An adapter that allows you to use any cache handler on the client and server side and switch between them. Adds support for running next.js applications in multiple instances.

## Advantages

* Shared cache between different instances (replicas, copies) of the application.
* Three caching options: local, remote and isomorphic.
* Same cacheHandler on the client and on the created server.
* Caching without server restart.
* Clearing of outdated cache.

## Installation

**Using npm:**
```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @nimpl/cache-adapter
```

## How it works

For a common cache between instances (replicas, copies) - the cache should be separate from each application instance. This solution does it by creating a separate service.

The application can then work with the cache through this remote server. The server acts as a cacheHandler and can be used from the running application and/or from the build mode.

The server does not need to be restarted each time. And outdated data will be deleted automatically when launching a new version of the application.
